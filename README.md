# Basic Verify Bot

This is a basic Discord bot designed for server verification. Originally made for **Ditpo**, but it's open for everyone to use! ðŸŽ‰

## Features

- Sends a verification message with a button.
- Creates private verification channels for users.
- Allows server staff to verify users manually.
- Automatically assigns the "Verified" role upon successful verification.  (you can change this but it's kinda hidden)
- Configurable settings for staff role, allowed users, and verification channels.
